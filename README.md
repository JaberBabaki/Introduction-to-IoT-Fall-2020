# IoT assignment #1 (design by S.Alireza Moazeni)
The purpose of this exercise is to examine the functions and capabilities of the IoT node. In this exercise, we use the NodeMCU board as one of the IoT nodes. The NodeMCU board is an open-source hardware platform suitable for IoT projects that require wireless connectivity.
To do this exercise, you will need a NodeMCU board, an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), and an LED Light Emitting Diode.

# IoT assignment #2 (design by Nazanin Akhtarian)
The purpose of this exercise is to get acquainted with Zigbee boards. These boards are designed for low-power networks and can provide you with a reliable connection between objects. Zigbee nets can consist of many boards and have a tree structure. The two main entities in these structures are the Coordinator and the End-Device. Each network must have a coordinator and can include multiple end-devices.

# IoT assignment #3 (design by Amirreza Ghafoori)
The purpose of this exercise is to learn more about LoRaWAN as an Internet of Things communication protocol. This exercise uses the OMNeT++ simulator, written in C++, and is used to simulate communication networks. OMNET ++ software simulates wired and wireless networks. This exercise also requires the FLoRa framework, which simulates the LoRaWAN network end-to-end.

# IoT assignment #4 (design by jaber babaki)
The purpose of this exercise is to become more familiar with and review the AMQP, HTTP, CoAP, MQTT protocols. In general, the Internet of Things has several protocols at different layers, each of which has a specific application and unique features. Therefore, in this exercise, implementation and exchange of information between nodes based on AMQP, HTTP, CoAP, MQTT protocol.
